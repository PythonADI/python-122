What is a file?
What properties do files have?
How do we read from and write to files in Python?

- File is a container in a computer system for storing data or information.
- Files have properties such as name, size, type, location (path), and permissions.
    - Name: The name of the file (e.g., data.txt).
    - Size: The amount of data stored in the file (e.g., 15 KB)
    - Type: The format of the file (e.g., text file, binary file, CSV file).
    - Location (Path): The directory or folder where the file is stored (e.g., /home/user/documents/data.txt).
    - Permissions: The access rights for the file (e.g., read, write, execute).
- In Python, we can read from and write to files using built-in functions like open(), read(), write(), and close().
- We can also use context managers (with statement) to handle files more efficiently and safely.
