# Homework 2: Python Basics

## Instructions

Complete the following exercises using the code and concepts from `workshop_1` and `workshop_2`. All work should be committed to your GitHub repository that you created in Homework 1.

### 1. Variables and Naming
- Create a Python script that defines at least three variables using proper naming conventions.
- Print their values.
- Use meaningful variable names that describe their purpose.

### 2. Type Casting
- Write a function that takes a string input and returns its integer value. Handle invalid input gracefully.
- Demonstrate the function with at least two examples.
- Include error handling for non-numeric inputs.

### 3. String Manipulation
- Create a function that takes a user's name as input and returns a greeting message in the format: `Hello, <Name>!`
- Use string formatting methods from `workshop_2/strings.py`.
- Add input validation to ensure the name isn't empty.

### 4. Average Calculation
- Write a script that asks the user for three numbers and prints their average.
- Use the logic from `workshop_2/average.py`.
- Format the output to display the average with 2 decimal places.
- Handle invalid inputs appropriately.

### 5. Input Basics
- Create a script that asks the user for their age and prints a message stating whether they are a minor or an adult.
- Use input handling techniques from `workshop_2/input_basics.py`.
- Add validation to ensure the age is a positive number.

## Submission Guidelines
1. Create a folder named `homework_2` in your GitHub repository.
2. Create separate `.py` files for each exercise (5 files total).
3. Include meaningful comments in your code explaining your logic.
4. Make sure to commit and push your changes to GitHub.
5. Test all your scripts to ensure they work as expected.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Proper use of Python syntax and conventions
- Implementation of error handling
- Code organization and readability
- Proper use of Git for version control
- Following the submission guidelines
